=head1 SDL2::Raw

A low-sugar binding to SDL2.

=head2 Status

There's a bunch of functions and structs already covered, but there's also a whole bunch of things I haven't touched at all. If you need any specific part of the API covered, feel free to open a ticket on github or even a pull request!

=head2 Examples

=head3 Snake

L<screenshots/snake_screenshot.png>

A simple Snake game. Control it with the arrow keys, guide your snake to eat the red circles, and avoid running into your tail.

This code uses C<Cairo> to create the images for the snake's body and tail.

=head3 Particles

L<screenshots/particles_screenshot.png>

A very simple particle system that spews white pixels from a central point that get pulled down by gravity and bounce on the floor.

=head3 Shooter

L<screenshots/shooter_screenshot.png>

A more complicated game. Control it with the arrow keys and hold the spacebar to fire.

The code also uses C<Cairo> to render the player's spaceship and the enemy spaceships. In generating the starfields it shows how to render to a texture with C<SDL2>.

=head3 White Noise

Just draws random white and black pixels to a texture and displays it.
